# Fetch-Rewards-Coding-Exercise

### Premise
This is the coding exercise required for the Mobile Software Engineer position at Fetch Rewards.
This Android application runs on Android API 28 and is made using Android Studio. This application
retrieves data from this [JSON file](https://fetch-hiring.s3.amazonaws.com/hiring.json) and groups
the data by "listID" and sorts them by "name." Since there are only four total "listId's," there
are four buttons for each "listId." When the user presses the button, it displays the information
on the screen.

### Result
